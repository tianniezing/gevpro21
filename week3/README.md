# Assignment

Unzip the assignment and install the required packages:

    $ unzip week3.zip
	$ cd week3
    $ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

## Open the notebook

Once everything is installed, start the Jupyter notebook as follows:

    $ jupyter notebook

This should open a browser with the Jupyter interface. Navigate to the directory with
this assignment, and open the .ipynb notebook for this assignment.

Follow the instructions in the notebook. When you are done, save your work and
close the notebook.

Finally, commit your work, push it to your repository, and submit the URL of
your repository to Nestor. Do NOT forget this step!

This week there are no tests, because the assignment is about exploratory data analysis.
However, naturally, correctness is still crucial!

Good luck!
